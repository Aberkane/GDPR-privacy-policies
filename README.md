# Towards Automated GDPR-compliance in Organizations: A Natural Language Processing Based Machine Learning Approach

## Abstract

Recent works show that privacy policies often do not meet the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements. To explore the underlying causes of non-compliance, this study leverages machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze data processing entities' organizational factors to identify the factors that affect GDPR-compliance practices as disclosed in privacy policies, to guide professionals and future research toward a nuanced understanding of GDPR-compliance. In particular, we have examined the effect of six organizational factors and their subclasses on the disclosure of five GDPR privacy policy core requirements in privacy policies. The contributions of this study are threefold. First, we have developed five NLP-based classification models---achieving a precision of at least 0.909---to assess the GDPR-compliance practices of data processing organizations as divulged in privacy policies. Second, we have collected a data set of 8\,614 organizations in the EU, containing organizational information and the GDPR-compliance promises derived from the organization's privacy policy. Lastly, we have analyzed the organizational factors that affect the disclosure of the five GDPR privacy policy core requirements in privacy policies. The analysis revealed, among other things, that being a public company typically positively affects the disclosure of the GDPR privacy policy core requirements. In contrast, the results reveal that being classified as a small and medium-sized enterprise negatively affects the disclosure of two GDPR privacy policy core requirements. Finally, concerning the impact of the location of the data processing entity, the results demonstrate that companies located in Ireland meet most of the GDPR requirements, while companies located in Poland fail to disclose the majority of the considered GDPR requirements.
